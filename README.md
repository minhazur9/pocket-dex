## Building Teams

If you sign up you may create your own teams. You will be able to add new ones, remove some, rename them and put in pokemon that you are planning on building by adjusting level, IVs, EVs, nature, ability, and held item. There will be a small display that will show the current stats of the pokemon in real time.
